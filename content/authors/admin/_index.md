# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hi, I’m Muhammad Ifte Khairul Islam. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia State University, where I worked on graph neural networks, graph compression, and contrastive learning. My research explores how advanced machine learning techniques can be applied to areas like bioinformatics, healthcare, and social networks. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Daffodil International University, Bangladesh. Beyond research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring, and building practical AI solutions that connect theory to real-world problems. I’m currently looking for opportunities in machine learning, data science, or teaching where I can apply my skills to meaningful challenges.
